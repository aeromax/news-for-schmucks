[{"duration":433.464,"captions":["Welcome to News for Schmucks — your one-stop dumpster fire of human stupidity, global dysfunction, and flaming corporate fart clouds. Buckle up, buttercup. Here comes your 5-minute round-up of today’s delusions, broken dreams, and authoritarian cosplay.","1. ﹡Putin meets Trump donor at Russian estate ahead of sanctions deadline﹡","Oh, fuck me with a babushka. Vladimir “I-wrestle-bears-for-breakfast” Putin met with Steve Witkoff — a major MAGA wallet and real estate bloodsucker — at his dacha. This cozy little chardonnay-fueled chat just so happened while U.S. sanctions were hanging overhead like the Sword of ‘Did-You-Think-We-Wouldn’t-Notice?’ Putin now gets to flash that diplomatic middle finger while hawking bad vodka and annexing lunchboxes. And Trump’s orbit, as always, is one big yacht full of oligarch groupies buttering up dictators. God bless capitalism... and kompromat.","2. ﹡Tim Cook holds closed-door meeting with Trump over Apple’s AI policies﹡","Tim “I Smirk In Code” Cook met with Diet Mussolini—aka Trump—at the White House to talk about Apple’s AI. Spoiler alert: no one knows what the hell AI is doing anymore, least of all a man who thinks an iPad is a “fancy Etch-a-Sketch.” Meanwhile, Cook's trying to keep Siri from becoming Skynet while dodging regulation like it’s a tax return. I swear, if we keep handing AI to these greedy buffoons, it’s gonna end up auto-subscribing us to Truth Social Premium.","3. ﹡Sen. Marsha Blackburn announces run for governor of Tennessee﹡","Oh joy, grab your moonshine and IQ-reducing earplugs—Marsha’s coming home. Tennessee’s queen of soundbites and six-grade-level gaffes says she’s running for governor. That’s right, the woman who once thought net neutrality was a communist breakfast cereal now wants executive power. Jesus wept. Next up? A billboard campaign reading “Now with 30% More Bible Thumping.”","4. ﹡South Park mocks Homeland Security in social media spat with Trump admin﹡","Welcome to the latest episode of “Cartoon Clowns Troll Real Government Clowns.” South Park roasted Homeland Security over its clueless attempts to regulate social media, and of course the Trump admins threw a fit like toddlers denied ketchup. When a show with talking poop characters serves more potent satire than Congress can muster in a decade, you know we’re nose-diving toward idiocracy at full fucking speed.","5. ﹡Italy gets final approval for €13.5B Sicily bridge project﹡","Well, color me shocked—Italy’s going forward with a bridge that’s been in the works since Caesar was picking olives. Costing €13.5 billion, it's basically the GDP of a medium-sized banana republic just to connect Sicily to the mainland. Because nothing says “smart infrastructure” like building a giant bridge in an earthquake zone overseen by a government that folds faster than a cheap lawn chair. Mama mia, this thing’s gonna collapse faster than Berlusconi’s last hair transplant.","6. ﹡Curiosity rover celebrates 13 years on Mars with ‘naps’ and coral discovery﹡","Meanwhile, our best employee is still a robot on fucking Mars. NASA’s Curiosity rover hit 13 years crawling that red dustball, taking selfies and now apparently discovering Martian “coral.” Which is either proof of ancient water or just Martian dandruff. Either way, Curiosity’s been more productive, loyal, and photogenic than 99% of Earth’s population — especially influencers and Congress combined.","7. ﹡China battles massive Chikungunya virus outbreak with aggressive measures﹡","Oh great, here we go again. China — birthplace of global pandemics and suspiciously opaque health data — is now staving off the Chikungunya virus. The name sounds like a dance craze, but it’s a mosquito-borne viral hellstorm. And of course “aggressive measures” means locking up cities faster than they censor Winnie the Pooh memes. Thick air, deadly mosquitos, and Orwellian tactics? China’s tourism pitch just writes itself.","8. ﹡American journalist found dead in Norway under ‘unusual circumstances’﹡","Well this is fucking terrifying. A U.S. journalist just turned up dead in Norway, of all places — that IKEA-filled socialist spa of a country — under “unusual circumstances.” Translation: foul play's not off the table, but we’ll whitewash it in fjord-scented politeness. Between this and our banana peel democracy, being a journalist is now more dangerous than base jumping into a Syrian munitions depot.","9. ﹡BBC reveals explosive files showing UK's cyberwarfare role﹡","Apparently the UK’s been swinging its cyber d*ck around in secret for years. Newly obtained documents show Britain’s deep-ass dive into cyberwarfare, including hacking and global surveillance. Awfully ballsy for a nation that still has a monarchy and can’t figure out basic train schedules. If MI6 spent less time cosplay-hacking like they're in a Bond movie and more time fixing NHS, maybe British teeth wouldn't still be a geopolitical punchline.","10. ﹡Trump’s deadline drama reignites Ukraine funding firestorm﹡","Of course it wouldn’t be a day ending in “y” unless Trump’s turning geopolitical chaos into a campaign bumper sticker. He’s now leveraging funding for Ukraine as political theater while Putin puts his boots up—literally. As usual, nobody knows what the hell this man is doing besides yelling on cable news, golfing like the planet isn’t melting, and leaving foreign policy to a Magic 8-Ball. “Will Ukraine survive?” — Outlook not so fucking good.","And there you go. Ten piles of hot garbage, barely dressed up as news. Join us again tomorrow for more \"Is this the darkest timeline or just Monday?\" right here on News for Schmucks. Now excuse me while I scream into a pillow full of shredded constitutions."]}]
